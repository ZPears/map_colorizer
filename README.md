# map_colorizer

This set of scripts takes in an image representing a map (see test_map for an example) and produces a colorized map that shows total distance from a given point on the map.

The lines in the map image represent roads - black lines are highways, dark gray lines are major streets and light gray lines are minor streets.

The user can specify an origin point, a walking speed (for the white space) and speed limits for the different road types.
